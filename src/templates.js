          Dear Team,

          Today we are making some significant changes to the structure of our team and the design of our ` +
          `organization which will result in approximately ${answers.get("numEmployeesLaidOff")} team members leaving ${answers.get("companyName")}. ` +
          `We believe these changes are necessary because of ${answers.get("layoffReason")} and ${answers.get("numInternetMemes")} internet memes.` +
          `\n\nWe know our unique culture, and our values of being kind, smart, and creative, are a reflection ` +
          `of the amazing people who work at ${answers.get("companyName")}. It pains me that many people I have deeply ` +
          `enjoyed working with, who I know firsthand are extremely talented, will no longer be members ` +
          `of our team at ${answers.get("companyName")}. We are infinitely grateful for your contributions, your hard ` +
          `work, and your ambition to make a positive impact in the world.
  
          ${answers.get("layoffEmailAuthor")}

          Please let me know if you'd like me to create another layoff email for you.

            I want to follow up on what we just covered at out all-company 
            meeting and share some context.
            
            Today we are making the unfortunate and difficult decision to 
            reduce the size of ${answers.get("companyName")}’s workforce by ${answers.get("percentageEmployeesLaidOff")}. This means we are 
            saying goodbye to ${answers.get("numEmployeesLaidOff")} of our talented colleagues. This 
            is a decision we did not take lightly, but it is one that we have
            conviction in to better serve our users, our business and our 
            mission over the long term. 
            
            Where we are and how we got here             
             
            Our company has changed and grown significantly over the past few 
            years. We should all be really proud of what we’ve been able to 
            accomplish together to serve the millions of people who turn to 
            Discord every day to spend time with their friends.

            At the same time, we have to face some hard truths. We grew 
            quickly and expanded our workforce even faster, increasing by 5x 
            since ${answers.get("layoffYear")}. As a result, we took on more projects and became less 
            efficient in how we operated.

            Today, we are increasingly clear on the need to sharpen our focus
            and improve the way we work together to bring more agility to our
            organization. This is what largely drove the decision to reduce the
            size of our workforce. While difficult, I am confident this will
            put us in the best position to continue building a strong and
            profitable business that delivers amazing products for our users 
            and supports our mission for years to come.

            What happens next

            I’m sure all of you are anxious to know what this means for each 
            of you.

            - By ${answers.get("numEmployeesLaidOff")}, everyone will receive an email. In your email, 
            you will learn whether or not your employment has been impacted by 
            this reduction-in-force

            - Leadership will hold a meeting with departing team members at 
            11:00 a.m. PT to discuss next steps

            - For all remaining employees, we will come back together this 
            afternoon at ${answers.get("meetingTime")} to talk about what’s next

            How we’re taking care of our colleagues

            It is incredibly important to me that we support departing team 
            members through this difficult time and provide them with a sizable
            runway as they transition into future employment. To that end, we 
            are offering them:

            - ${answers.get("monthsOfSalary")} months of salary (plus an additional week for every full year at Discord)

            - Five months of benefit continuation

            Take care of yourselves and let’s look out for each other through
            this particularly challenging time.

                Today I’m sharing some of the most difficult changes we’ve made in ${answers.get("companyName")}’s history. I’ve decided to reduce the size of our team by about ${answers.get("numEmployeesLaidOff")} and let more than ${answers.get("percentageEmployeesLaidOff")} of our talented employees go. We are also taking a number of additional steps to become a leaner and more efficient company by cutting discretionary spending and extending our hiring freeze through Q1.

                I want to take accountability for these decisions and for how we got here. I know this is tough for everyone, and I’m especially sorry to those impacted.

        return `hi all.

          today we’ll be making some org changes, including eliminating roles and beginning the consultation process in countries where required. i want to give you all the straight facts.

          as I said at the last meeting, there are three areas we’d like to address:

          strategy: reducing from teams that are off strategy, and fixing our discipline ratios.
          performance: parting ways with people with a “${answers.get("perfRating")}” or trending towards “${answers.get("perfRating")}.”
          hierarchy: driving to ${answers.get("hierarchy")} our org to a max depth of innercore+4
          what that translates to in actual numbers of people:

          strategy: 391 people
          performance: 460 people
          hierarchy: ${answers.get("numManagersMoveToICRoles")} managers (with 193 moving it individual contributor roles)
          we’re also closing all the 748 roles we had open with the exception of:

          roles progressed to offer stage.
          critical operational roles
          start/accelerate roles
          key leadership roles
          none of the above points are trying to hit a specific financial target, replacing folks with ${answers.get("folksReplacedWith")}, or changing our headcount cap. they are specific to our needs around strategy, raising the bar and acting faster on performance, and flattening our org so we can move faster and with less abstraction.

          why do this all at once instead of over time? we’re behind in our actions, and that’s not fair to the individuals who work here or the company. when we know, we should move, and there hasn’t been enough movement. we need to move to help us meet and stay ahead of the transformational moment our industry is in.

          this is the ${answers.get("difficultyLevel")} part of my job, and I fight hard against any of these considerations. we must have a very high bar of correctness for us to take any action, which takes iteration and time to get right. i always balance this with the fact that everyone here, and those that are departing, has equity in our company. it’s my job to increase that value. we believe this will help us focus and execute better to do just that.

          we’re working to give clarity to everyone as quickly, with as much context and support, as possible. you’ll receive ${answers.get("wayToCommunicate")} soon about what this means for you. if there are areas where you think we could do better, please send me a note. direct feedback makes us better, and I always act when it makes sense.

          thank you to all those leaving us. i am grateful and appreciative for you and your work, which has built us up to this point. we will continue to honor that by increasing our value to our customers, and therefore to all of our shareholders, including you.

          thank you,
